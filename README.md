# parser
The object of this project is to build a recursive descent parser for the programming language described by the grammar that follows.

## The recursive descent parser should perform only 2 tasks:
1. Print out a comment string indicating if an inputted program file contained a valid program or not and
2. If the program is valid (and only if the program is valid), it should print out a customized version of the code
